<p><span class="smcap">Area.</span>—This field lies in the three
counties, Athens, Perry and Morgan. Leaving out of consideration at
present a few small outlying pools, and starting at the south, the
productive territory may be said to begin in Section 22, Trimple
township, Athens county. From this point it runs almost due north to
the Perry county line. The widest part of this portion of the field
does not exceed one-half mile, while the narrowest portion permits of a
single row only of wells.</p>

<div class="footnote space-above1 space-below2"><p class="no-indent">
<a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[A]</a>

</div>

<p>It enters Monroe township, Perry county in Section 33, and runs almost
due north towards Corning, but bends to the northeast about one mile
south of that place. Here the productive territory attains a maximum
width of 3 miles, the greatest in the field. The northeast course is
continued to the Morgan county line, where it turns due north, skirting
that line with a productive strip about one-half mile wide for 2½
miles, when it turns slightly to the east, entering Morgan county in
Section 31 of Deerfield township. From that place it extends through
Section 30 and into Section 19, beyond which it has not been traced.
Development of this part of the field is retarded by floods of salt
water which may limit it in this direction. The total length of the
field is about 14 miles.</p>

<p>Outside of this belt are four pools, two of which are of little
importance. One lies around Glouster, and has an area of less than one
square mile. A second one lies in Sections 22 and 29, a short distance
northwest of Glouster. This is the principal territory from which the
gas of Corning and surrounding towns is derived. A third pool lies
around Porterville, and the fourth known as the Oakfield lies from 3 to
5 miles north of Corning. It includes parts of sections 5, 21, 28, 29,
32, and 33 of Pleasant and 22, 27 and 34 of Bearfield townships. It is
in this pool that the most extensive work is being done at the present time.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Discovery.</span>—Probably the first deep well
drilled in the Sunday Creek Valley was near Burr Oak, about 4 miles
south of Corning. Its date is not now known, but it must have been 40
or more years ago. Its depth is likewise unknown, but it is reported
to have penetrated the salt sand. To this day it flows salt water, and
with it sufficient gas to be ignited. This well, however, seems not to
have aroused suspicion that there might be valuable liquids other than
salt water buried in the rocks.</p>

<p>The discovery of oil in the Corning field was a matter of accident,
and resulted directly from a scarcity of water for the Toledo and Ohio
Central railroad. To remedy this a deep well was drilled in August,
1891, at the round-house, about three-fourths of a mile south of
Corning. The only water found was in the salt sand which is reported as
having been struck at a depth of 630 feet. The supply was copious, but
the salinity prevented its being used in locomotives. This brine was
shut out of the well by casing and the drill forced down to a depth of
1507 feet. Finding no water at that depth the work ceased, but a few
days later oil was thrown to the top of the derrick, and there were
smaller eruptions later. However further disturbances of this sort were
prevented by the company closing the well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Development.</span>—The disclosure made by
this well attracted the attention of oil men who immediately entered
the field and began leasing territory. The citizens of Corning
feared the territory was falling into the hands of the Standard Oil
Company, and that it might not under such conditions be developed for
years. Accordingly a home company styled “The Sunday Creek Oil &amp;
Gas Company,” was organized in February, 1892, to make certain the
development of the territory. The capital stock was placed at $10,000
in shares of $50, and $8900 of the stock was sold. Much of this was
raised by citizens of the town subscribing for single shares.</p>

<p>The new Company was successful. By January 1st, 1898, 255% in dividends
had actually been paid the stock holders. In September, 1898, a
power for pumping the wells, and costing over $7000, was erected,
the contractor taking the product of the wells until it paid for the
plant. In November, 1899, the property together with $1250—the amount
received in excess of the cost of the plant—was turned over to the
original holders. The power is now (July 1, 1900,) pumping 20 wells,
which have a daily production of 40 barrels.</p>

<p>The first well drilled by this Company was on the William Fisher farm
in northwest quarter section 14, Monroe township, Perry county. The
Berea was struck at 1012 feet, but the indications were so unfavorable
for a paying well that it was not considered advisable to shoot it.
However, on June 2d, 1892, after waiting nearly a month, the well was
shot with 80 quarts of nitro-glycerine, which had been hauled from
Sistersville, W. Va. The cost of the shot was $200. The first day
following the shooting of the well it produced 12 barrels, and a year
later was still producing 10 barrels per day. Following this other
wells were drilled in sections 14 and 15. In all 25 have been drilled,
only 3 of which were dry holes.

Other companies began work and the territory was rapidly leased and
tested. Naturally operations began near the round-house where oil had
first been shown to exist. From this as a center the drill moved out
in all directions until the limits of the field had been disclosed.
The later work has been along the northeast end of the territory in
Morgan county, where the oil seems to be shut out by reservoirs of
salt water. During the present summer (1900) the valuable pool in the
Oakfield district has been developed, though small wells had been
found there several years earlier. The principal farms are the Porter,
Longstreth, Donnelly, Monahan, McDonald and Grenen. The first well was
on the Porter farm and was finished early in 1900. Its production was
35 barrels the first day. The second well was on the Monahan farm. It
was completed soon after the Porter well and had an initial flow of 45
barrels in 24 hours. The next two wells were drilled on the Longstreth
farm, and both were fair producers. Early in the Spring a well was
completed on the Donnelly farm and flowed 125 barrels the first day.
Other wells on this farm are much smaller. Two wells on the Grenen
farm began flowing 675 and 90 barrels respectively. It is interesting
to note that the development of this, the richest part of the Corning
field, occurred late in the territory’s history. Possibly other pools
of equal richness may yet be discovered lying near the principal field.</p>

<p>An important step in the development of the field occurred on August
13th, 1893 when the Buckeye Pipe Line was completed. Before that the
oil was transported by tank cars. The oil which is brought to the tanks
partly by gravity and partly by suction, the latter being produced by
an 8 horse-power gas engine, is stored in two iron tanks, one of which
has a capacity of 30,000, and the other 28,000 barrels. From these
tanks the oil is forced to Elba, a distance of 34 miles, through a 4
inch line. This work is done by a 35 horse-power engine which gives a
pressure in the line of from 700 to 1000 pounds per square inch. The
rate at which the oil is transported varies with the temperature. In
the summer when the oil is warm, and hence thin, 128 barrels may be
pumped in one hour, but in the winter when the oil is cold and thick
the transportation may be restricted to 11 barrels for the same period.</p>

<p>When the pipe line was completed the production of the field was about
500 barrels per day. It increased to 1300 barrels in 1896, but since
then has declined. At present it ranges from 800 to 900 barrels per
day. The total production of the field is shown by the following letter:

<p class="space-above2"><span class="smcap">Leases.</span>—At first
the operators paid no bonuses, but gave a royalty of one-eighth of the
oil to the land owners—a rate of compensation that has been usually
maintained. To this there is one exception worthy of note. When the
round-house well showed the existence of oil, and operators began
leasing the surrounding territory, Fredrick Weaver, a thrifty German
farmer residing a short distance east from the round-house, quietly
visited the oil fields of Washington, Pennsylvania, and investigated
the methods of leasing oil territory in that field. When he returned
home he demanded a royalty of one-fourth the oil and a bonus of $200
for each of the eight wells which it was proposed should be drilled
on his farm of eighty acres, and since his territory was regarded as
very promising, these rather severe terms were granted. However, after
drilling six wells, and the territory not meeting expectations, the
contractors complained and Mr. Weaver generously reduced the bonus.
More recently a royalty of one-sixth the oil has been received by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
holders of lands that were deemed especially promising, and bonuses
also have been received. The leases usually required that a well be
drilled in from thirty to sixty days, but sometimes, especially in the
least promising territory, six months were allowed.</p>

<span class="smcap">Geology of the Region.</span>—The surface of the
territory lies in the Lower Productive and Lower Barren coal measures.
The highest hills reach up to or extend above the Ames or Crinoidal
limestone. In fact along the northeast extremity of the field the hills
are capped by the limestones which underlie the Pittsburgh coal. The
deepest valley—that of Sunday Creek—cuts through the Middle Kittanning
coal, a short distance north of Corning, but at this town the seam
named is under cover, while the Upper Freeport coal is at about
drainage level.</p>

<p>The succession of strata under ground is shown by the following
record kept and furnished the Survey by Mr. G. W. Delong,
Superintendent of Schools, Corning. The well is located on lot 154 of
the town just named, and the top of the well lies at the base of the
Mahoning sandstone:</p>

The depth of the well as shown by the steel line is 1012½ feet. It
was drilled in the Fall of 1896, and was shot with twenty quarts of
nitro-glycerine. It began flowing thirty barrels per day, but the
production has diminished until at present it is producing only one
barrel per day. Below the Berea the Bedford shales are found in their
normal conditions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Oil Sand.</span>—This is in all cases the
Berea. The sand has the light gray color so common in this formation
in other parts of the state. It is moderately fine grained, but there
is considerable variation in this respect. Usually it is a pure quartz
sand, but occasionally has thin layers of dark shaly material running
through it. In thickness it shows considerable variation, but never
disappears in this field. The normal thickness is usually given as
twenty feet and the maximum reported is eighty feet. This depth was
found on the Potts farm about one and one-fourth miles northeast of
Corning, and on the O’Farrell farm about two miles east from the same
town. In both cases a dark gray shale, probably the Ohio, lay below.
The Bedford on this theory had been swept away before the Berea was
deposited. In such abnormal depths the additions always appear to be on
the bottom, showing that the surface of the underlying Bedford shale
was quite uneven. Here, as elsewhere in the state, the drill shows the
upper surface of the Berea to be uniform. It is worthy of note that the
production of oil does not vary as the thickness of the sand. In fact
in this field the great thicknesses are generally poor producers.</p>

<p>The “pay streak” or that containing the oil and gas ranges in thickness
from 3 to 8 feet, but very few of the wells attain the maximum figure.
Towards the margin of the productive field the “pay streak” thins, and
finally disappears. The top of the “pay” usually lies from 10 to 15
feet below the surface of the Berea. As a rule the “pay” is coarser
than other parts of the Berea, and generally the coarser the rock the
larger the well. Sometimes in the thick part of the Berea there are two
“pay streaks.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Wells.</span>—The number of wells producing
July 1, 1900, exceeded 600. About 100 dry holes have been drilled and
about an equal number of wells have been abandoned, so that 800 is a
fair approximation of the total number of wells drilled in the field.
As a rule a well has been put down for each 8 to 10 acres of surface
territory.</p>

<p>The wells have been cased through the salt sand, a depth of 555 feet in
the valley at Corning. The casing has almost invariably been 5⅝ inches,
inside measurement. The rocks comprising the underlying 160-180 feet,
and terminating with the “Little Salt Sand” have furnished some water
which has been disastrous to the wells. It reduced the gas pressure,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
thus necessitating pumping the wells earlier than otherwise would have
been required, and perhaps prematurely destroying the life of the well.
Had the wells been cased through the “Little Salt Sand” time and money
would have been saved, and the production of the field would have been
larger.</p>

<p>The western side of the field is quite free from salt water. It is on
that side that the principal gas territory lies. On the eastern side of
the field the conditions are more variable. In Trimble township, Athens
county, the wells are free from water, while in Monroe township, Perry
county, salt water is found in the northeast corner, and in Morgan
county it is so abundant that operating is prevented. From this it
appears that the western side of the Corning field is free from salt
water, and that it is absent also on the eastern side at the southern
margin of the territory, but that it increases rapidly to the northeast.</p>

<p>While the production of the wells after being shot has varied greatly,
yet they have not furnished the great extremes that many other fields
have. Few, if any of the wells, have started better than 125 barrels
per day, and it has been estimated that the average for the entire
field has been 20 barrels.</p>

<p>The wells have sufficient gas pressure to flow them during the earlier
part of their lives, but later as the pressure diminishes they have to
be pumped. Since the eastern side of the field has salt water the wells
there have to be pumped earlier than those on the western side.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Gas Wells.</span>—The principal gas
territory is that along Muddy Fork in Sections 22 and 29 Trimble
township, Athens county, the best wells being found in the western half
of the latter section on the lands of the Hocking Coal and Railroad
company. The largest well in this field started at 3,000,000 cubic feet
per day with a rock pressure of 400 pounds. It was drilled in the fall
of 1897, and one year later was producing 2,000,000 cubic feet per day,
and still another year later 1,500,000 cubic feet. Of the other wells
in this territory two started at 2,000,000 feet each, two at 1,000,000
feet each, and three at 500,000 feet each. The decline in the smaller
wells was not as rapid as in the larger ones since the demands made on
them were not as heavy. Thus far no dry holes have been found in this
territory. The reliance of the community is on this field where 5,000
acres are leased in one block.</p>

<p>Another district that has yielded considerable gas is that at Oakfield
about 3 miles north of Corning. These wells started at 2,000,000,
1,500,000, 500,000, and 250,000 cubic feet per day respectively. Two
of the smaller of these have been abandoned after having produced for
two years. The largest of these wells, now four years old, is producing
500,000 cubic feet per day, and the second largest, now three years
old, is producing the same amount. The wells in this field produce
considerable oil and by some are rated as oil wells rather than gas ones.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span></p>

<p>Outside of these two places an occasional strip is found that produces
gas in paying quantities. Thus about one mile northeast of Corning
two wells were drilled, which combined produced 500,000 cubic feet
per day. They produced three years and were then abandoned. About two
miles north of Corning a good well was drilled on the Newberry farm. It
started at 1,500,000 cubic feet per day, had an initial rock pressure
of 400 pounds and lasted three years.</p>

<p>Another productive tract lies about 6 miles northeast of Corning on
the Finley, Devore and Stoneburner farms. Three wells were drilled on
the Finley farm, and started one at 1,500,000 and two at 250,000 cubic
feet, with an initial rock pressure of 400 pounds. These wells lasted
three years.</p>

<p>The operators of the wells have been much troubled with salt water
in the Muddy Fork field and with oil in the Oakfield territory. Salt
water is removed by “blowing” the wells. For this operation the wells
are closed for a short period, usually about 30 minutes, allowing the
gas pressure to increase; when this has become sufficiently strong the
well is opened at the top and the gas then blows the water from the
well. When the well has been cleansed in this manner it is closed and
the gas turned back into the mains. Sometimes, however, the weight of
the water is so great that the gas cannot drive it from the well in
the manner just stated, especially is this true with wells that have
been in use for a considerable period. Then an iron rod attached to a
long pole is let down through the water, is raised and lowered, and
the gas following the pole in its ascent finally drives the water from
the well. This method of cleaning is known as “agitating.” Finally the
pressure of the gas becomes so small that it cannot lift the water with
the help of “agitating,” and then the well is dead. In winter time each
well is cleaned every other day, and in the summer twice a week.</p>

<p>The gas wells in the Corning field are owned and operated by the
Corning Natural Gas Company. It supplies Jacksonville, Trimble,
Glouster, Murray City, New Straitsville, Shawnee, Hemlock, Corning,
Rendville, Moxahala, New Lexington, and several interior hamlets.
Almost the sole use of the fuel is for heat and light.</p>

<p>The company makes a rate of 20 cents per thousand feet by meter. Where
the meter is not used, the prices in winter are $2.00 per month for the
first fire; $1.50 for the second; $1.00 for the third; 75 cents for the
fourth, and all additional fires at the latter figure. In the summer a
charge of $1.50 for each cooking fire is made. For lights the charges
are 25 cents each for the first two and 15 cents for each additional one.</p>

<p>The number of customers supplied by this company in 1900 was
approximately as follows:

<p class="space-above1">In the Fall of 1899 the wells of the company
produced 6,000,000 cubic feet per day, but during cold weather when the
demand for fuel was great they dropped to 3,000,000 cubic feet, and the
rock pressure which was 300 pounds in the Fall was only 200 during the
winter. On July 7th, 1900, the rock pressure of the wells in the Muddy
Fork field ranged from 170 to 280 pounds, indicating a considerable
drop from that of the preceding autumn. The company expects to drill
four additional wells during the ensuing fall (1900) in the Muddy Fork
territory, and by so doing expects to keep three wells closed, and thus
maintain a good rock pressure.</p>

<p>There were 2025 species reported in the Fourth State Catalogue (1899)
for the State of Ohio. This number was supposed to be approximately
correct, since those of previous lists were discarded which are known
to have been erroneously identified or were unquestionably beyond
our range. In the First Annual Supplement sixty-nine additions were
made, and in Additions to the Ohio Flora, (O. S. U. NATURALIST, 1:15)
twenty-two more were recorded. Therefore those enumerated above bring
our grand total to 2128 species of Pteridophytes and Spermatophytes.</p>

<p class="f120 space-below2"><span class="smcap">James S. Hine.</span></p>

<p><i>Gomphus viridifrons</i> n. sp. Length of the abdomen about 33 mm.,
hind wing about 27 mm.; black, face and occiput green; prothorax with
anterior margin and three spots green or yellow; thorax green with
spaces at base of wings, lateral suture and six bands before black,
the two middle bands are abbreviated anteriorly and separated by the
mid-dorsal carina which is very feebly green. Abdomen black, a dorsal
band and sides of first two or three segments yellowish, a yellow spot
at base of each of segments four to seven, and sides of eight and nine
usually yellowish.</p>

<p>Abdominal appendages of the male straight, about as long as the tenth
segment, from above, widest at base, gradually narrowed from apical
third and acute at apex; from the side prominently widened at base,
with a strong tooth beneath at two-thirds of the length. Hamules large,
of nearly the same width for the whole length and ending behind in a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
hooked process. Vulvar scale almost as long as the ninth abdominal
segment, gradually narrowed, apical third divided and the two parts
divaricate.</p>

<p>Described from fourteen males and a female taken at Loudonville, Ohio,
June 14, 1900; and a male and female taken at Ohio Pile, Pa.—the
latter two specimens by E. B. Williamson.</p>

<p>The species averages larger than either <i>brevis</i> or
<i>abbreviatus</i> and may be separated from the former readily by
its green face, by the striking differences in the vulvar lamina and
by the hamules and male appendages. In <i>brevis</i> the tooth on
the appendage is nearer the end and the space from it to appex is
noticeably curved while in <i>viridifrons</i> this space is practically
straight.</p>

<p>It has more points in common with <i>abbreviatus</i>, but in that
species the vulvar scale is short and triangular, the hamules are
smaller and shorter, and the tooth on the superior appendage of the
male is much farther from the apex.</p>

<p>Through the kindness of Dr. Calvert and Mr. Williamson I have at my
disposal, specimens from which many of the accompanying drawings were
made. In <i>viridifrons</i>, <i>brevis</i> and <i>abbreviatus</i> I
have made drawings from different specimens of the same species to show
slight variations.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="GOMPHUS_FURCIFER">A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF<br /> GOMPHUS FURCIFER AND VILLOSIPES.</h2>
</div>

<p class="f120 space-below2"><span class="smcap">James S. Hine.</span></p>

<p>It seems that nearly every author who has considered these two species
has compared them. Considering general appearances they are much alike
but can be separated easily by several details and as I have good
material of both sexes of the two species before me, I thought it
might be of consequence to consider in a comparative way some of their
characteristics.</p>

<p>The occiput in both sexes of <i>villosipes</i> bears a prominent tooth
at the middle of its upper edge. This tooth varies some in different
specimens, it ends above in a single point or it may be widened and end
above in three or more points. In <i>furcifer</i> there is no tooth on
the occiput in either sex.</p>

<p>The vulvar scales are very different, in <i>villosipes</i> the part
may be said to be triangular with the free sides curved and the apical
part divided for about half the length of the scale. In <i>furcifer</i>
its basal part is similar but the apical part is produced, giving
quite a different form. In the former species the scale is about
one-third as long as the ninth segment, while in the latter it is about
three-eighths as long as that segment.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span></p>

<p>The abdominal appendages of the male are different. From dorsal view
those of <i>furcifer</i> are rectangular with the inner distal angle
very much produced inward and backward; in <i>villosipes</i> they are
wide at base, oblong, with the outer distal part broadly rounded and
the corresponding inner part produced directly backward. The hamules
are characteristic and may be explained best by reference to the
figures.</p>

<p>The two species are colored much alike but <i>furcifer</i> is darker.
The tenth abdominal segment may be said to be yellow in both but in
<i>furcifer</i> the sides of the segment are dark, oftentimes black.</p>

<p>They agree in habits, both preferring to fly over stagnant water
where the males come to rest on floating objects or on the ground
at the water’s edge. I have observed the female of <i>furcifer</i>
ovipositing in stagnant water among lily pads and other aquatic plants.
Her flight is slow while thus engaged, and her actions more like a
<i>Libellula</i> than the usual <i>Gomphus</i>.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="NOTES">NOTES FROM BOTANICAL<br /> LITERATURE.</h2>
</div>

<p class="f120 space-below2"><span class="smcap">W. A. Kellerman.</span></p>

<p>A very interesting Bulletin of eight pages on the Chrysanthemum Rust
has been issued by J. C. Arthur, botanist of the Indiana Agricultural
Experiment Station. It is No. 85, and is dated October, 1900. Dr.
Arthur gives a general account of Uredineae or Rusts, explaining
that the typical forms have three prominent sets of spores, namely
(1) aecidiospores, usually red or orange in little white cups, (2)
uredospores, generally of a rusty yellow color and abundant (hence
the group name, Rusts), and (3) teleutospores, or the Winter spores,
usually dark brown or black. He further states that only uredospores
have yet been found in Europe and America, and since the fungus is an
annual, it is puzzling to see how it escapes extermination in winter
and spring when Chrysanthemum plants are latent.</p>

<p>The assumption that this was the well known and common Puccinia
hieracii or Puccinia tanaceti he proves to be incorrect by inoculation
experiments. Uredospores from Chrysanthemums he sowed on Chrysanthemums
and obtained a crop of uredospores. Similar uredospores sowed on
Dandelion, Burdock, and Ox-eye Daisy produced no infection; uredospores
from the latter hosts sown on Chrysanthemum likewise produced no
infection. Uredospores from Dandelion sown on Dandelion produced
uredospores. Others have tried similar experiments, using Tansy,
Costmary, Orange Hawkweed, Giant Daisy, and Marguerite, besides the
host plants named above, but the Chrysanthemum Rust refuses to grow
on any of them. This Rust, which is common and well known on the
Chrysanthemum in Japan, has been named Puccinia chrysanthemi by Rose.</p>

<p>In connection with suggestions relative to combating the disease,
Dr. Arthur says that “so long as the teleutospores do not make an
appearance in this country, the careful cultivator may feel assured
that a moderate amount of timely effort will enable him to rid
his establishment of the Rust, if he is so unfortunate as to have
it donated to him by some careless florist. Observations made by
the writer and others show that the tendency is for the disease
to disappear of itself, to run its course in an establishment and
die out, which is very likely to some extent due to the absence of
teleutospores.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bryology.</span>—Mrs. Britton’s popular articles
on the Mosses and how to study them, that have appeared from time to
time, furnished the directions and incentive to many who before had
taken little or no interest in this group of plants. Her purpose and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
plan are imitated and extended in a charming little book, that has been
prepared and published by Dr. A. J. Grout, of the Boys’ High School,
Brooklyn, New York, called “Mosses with a Hand-Lens.” The author says
that many years of study of Mosses in the field and in Herbaria have
convinced him that “any person of average intelligence can easily learn
to recognize seventy to one hundred common mosses, with the aid of a
hand-lens of ten to fifteen diameters magnifying power.”</p>

<div id="FIG_9" class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/i020.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="502" />
  <p class="f120 space-below2">Fig. 9, Ceratodon.</p>
</div>

<p>I have Dr. Grout’s permission to reproduce two illustrations, which
represent fairly that phase of his valuable book. <a href="#FIG_9">Figure 9</a>
shows Ceratodon purpureus L, and the text pertaining to the same is as
follows: “Ceratodon is one of the commonest of all our mosses. It
is found on the edges of paths, roofs of old buildings, sand by the
seashore, and in general any barren compact soil is its favorite
habitat. The plants are short and grow close together, forming dense
thin mats of dark green. The lance-like young sporophytes appear early
in spring as soon as the snow is melted. By the middle of summer the
capsules often decay beyond recognition, and the seta breaks from the
plant at the touch.</p>

<p>Unless one has become very familiar with Ceratodon it is not always
easy to recognize it without mature capsules. When the capsules have
fully matured they shrink when dry and become furrowed. This peculiar
furrowing, the dark rich color of the capsules, a color called purple
by the older botanists, but which is really a very dark chestnut or
red-brown, make it easy to recognize this species.”</p>

<p><a href="#PLATE_II">Plate II</a>. shows the Hair-cap Mosses,
Polytrichum, the largest of all our species. There are four common
species all having square capsules which character distinguishes them
from Pogonatums, the latter having cylindric capsules. “The Ohio
Hair-cap without the sporophyte (seta and capsule, commonly called
fruit) is not readily distinguished from the Common, as the leaves and
general appearance are very similar. But with the sporophyte present,
the distinctions are clear. In Figs. b and d (<a href="#PLATE_II">Plate II</a>.)
note that the capsule of the Common Hair-cap is almost
cubical, that the lid has a <i>very short beak</i>, and that the
capsule is entirely covered by the calyptra. The capsule of the Ohio
Hair-cap (e) is elongated, slender with a tapering neck, and with a
much longer beak to the lid. The lid and the calyptra of the Ohio
Hair-cap fall early in June, very soon after the spores are ripe, and
it is not always easy to find either in position, but if the calyptra
be found, it will be seen to cover the upper portion of the capsule
only. The Common Hair-cap, although occurring in woods, is most common
in open fields; the Ohio Hair-cap being most frequent in shady, more
moist spots, often in deep woods. The remaining two species are easily
distinguished from the two mentioned above by the margins of the
leaves, which are thin and membranaceous, and are folded in over the
central portion of the leaf, <a href="#PLATE_II">as illustrated</a>
in o, o′ and p.”

I can not too strongly commend “Mosses with a Hand-Lens” (price $1.10)
prepared with the purpose of giving “by drawings and descriptions the
information necessary to enable any one interested to become acquainted
with the more common mosses with the least possible outlay of time,
patience and money.” The book contains a key to the genera based mainly
on structural characters and one mainly on habitat, also many keys
under the genera; copious illustrations, clear and accurate on almost
every page of the text and eight full-page plates from drawings by Mary
V. Thayer; and an illustrated glossary of bryological terms.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="MEETING">MEETING OF THE<br /> BIOLOGICAL CLUB.</h2>
</div>

<p>The Biological Club met in Zoological lecture room December 3, 1900.
Prof. Herbert Osborn presided, twenty-six members present. The
following papers were presented:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Notes on the Saw Brier, and a Rhamnus new to Ohio.”</p>

<p>“The Waverly Series of Ohio.”</p>
</div>

<p>In the first paper Prof. Kellerman spoke of the distribution of the
Saw Brier, <i>Smilax glauca</i>, in the southern part of the State, and
exhibited specimens showing its striking variations in form of leaves.</p>

<p>The southern buckthorne, <i>Rhamnus caroliniana</i>, was observed
commonly in Adams County. It also occurs in Brown County. This is
the first record for this species in Ohio. Specimens in fruit were
exhibited.</p>

<p>A hackberry was found unlike any form hitherto reported from
Ohio. Specimens are in the hands of Rev. E. J. Hill for study and
determination.</p>

<p>Prof. Ball reported leaf variation as occurring commonly in Colorado,
and that various leaf forms could be observed in climbing a single hill.</p>

<p>Prof. Prosser, in the second paper, reviewed the literature that has
been published on the Waverly Series of Ohio, and as a summing up gave
a list of names with authorities to be used in future in speaking of
the formations of this series. These are as follows:</p>

<p>Beginning above the Huron Shale. 1. Bedford Shale (Newb.) 85 feet. 2.
Berea Grit (Newb.) 40 feet. 3. Sunbury Shale (Hicks) 10-15 feet. 4.
Cuyahoga Shale (Newb.) 275-300 feet. 5. Black Hand Conglomerate (Hicks)
40-100 feet. 6. Logan Sandstone (Andrews) 115 feet.</p>

<p>Under the head of personal observations, Prof. Schaffner gave a list
of trees and shrubs which he and F. J. Tyler had found cutting off
(self-pruning) their own branches.</p>

<p>Prof. Kellerman remarked upon the abundance of the red-seeded dandelion
in various parts of the state.</p>

<p>Walter Metz, J. A. Beer, H. A. Clark, Charles I. Meade, Miss Elizabeth
Sessions, Miss L. D. Wilson, W. P. Simpson, Mrs. J. H. Schaffner, B.
B. Wells, Mrs. E. D. Ball, J. N. Frank, A. G. McCall, Miss Carrie R.
Weick, A. C. Whitmore, Miss Caroline Meade and Miss Maud Flynn were
elected to membership.</p>

<p>Professors Prosser, Landacre and Mr. Griggs were appointed a committee
to locate board and lodging for members of the Ohio Academy of Science.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that:

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
